	    	"question":" Vitamin E is one of the few major nutrients not listed on nutrition labels, in part because only a few foods contain significant amounts. What are the best sources? ", 
	    	"choices": ["eggs", "wheat germ","safflower oil","nuts"],
	    	"answer": "(b, c, and d) Vegetable oils (except olive oil) and products made from them (such as margarine) are the richest sources. Nuts and wheat germ are also good. But most foods rich in vitamin E are very high in fat. ",

	    	"question":"If you're looking for the most fiber in a loaf of bread, the operative words are ", 
	    	"choices": ["unbleached", "enriched wheat flour","whole-wheat flour","twelve-grain"],
	    	"answer": "(c) Whole-wheat flour contains the bran and the germ, and thus is rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Wheat flour, whether bleached or unbleached, loses vitamins and minerals when it is refined. Even when it is enriched, only some—not all—of these nutrients are added back in. 'Twelve-grain' or 'seven-grain' may not mean anything, since the bread can still be mostly re-fined wheat ('white') flour. Most rye and pumpernickel contain little or no whole grain, but if you can find whole-grain versions, they are good, too.",
